# Custom Wake Word for Ammu AI

Welcome to the **Custom Wake Word** directory for **Ammu AI**! This repository contains the **custom TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) wake word model** specifically trained to recognize the trigger word **"Ammu"**. This allows **Ammu AI** to be activated by voice without relying on generic wake words like "OK Google" or "Hey Siri".

## 🔹 How the Custom Wake Word Works
Ammu AI leverages **OpenWakeWord**, an open-source wake word detection system, to recognize the custom **"Ammu"** wake word. This enables a **low-latency, offline voice activation system** that integrates seamlessly with **Home Assistant Voice Assistant**.

### 🚀 Features
- **Custom-trained model** for precise recognition of "Ammu".
- **Runs entirely offline**, ensuring privacy and fast response time.
- **Optimized for ESP32-S3 & Edge AI devices** running ESPHome.
- **Minimal resource consumption**, making it ideal for smart home applications.
- **Easily updatable** by replacing the wake word model.

## 🔹 Installation Guide
To set up the **Ammu** wake word, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ **Download the Custom Wake Word Model**
Download the latest version of the **Ammu wake word model** from the GitHub repository:

🔗 [Download `ammu.tflite`](https://github.com/kiranvenom1209/ammuai/tree/main/custom_wake_word/ammu.tflite)

### 2️⃣ **Transfer the Model to Home Assistant**
Once you have downloaded the **`ammu.tflite`** file, you need to place it in the **Home Assistant Local Directory** using the **Samba Share** integration.

#### 🔹 Steps to Install Samba Share on Home Assistant:
1. Open **Home Assistant**.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Add-ons**.
3. Click **Add-On Store**.
4. Search for **Samba Share** and install it.
5. Start the **Samba Share** service and enable **Start on Boot**.
6. From your PC, access the **Home Assistant local storage** via File Explorer:
   - On Windows: `\\homeassistant\config`
   - On macOS: `smb://homeassistant.local/config`
7. Create a folder named `wakeword/` (if it does not exist) inside `config/`.
8. Copy the `ammu.tflite` file into `config/wakeword/`.

🔹 **Expected Path:** `/config/wakeword/ammu.tflite`

### 3️⃣ **Install OpenWakeWord in Home Assistant**
Ammu AI uses **OpenWakeWord** for real-time wake word detection.

#### 🔹 Steps to Install OpenWakeWord:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Add-ons**.
2. Click **Add-On Store**.
3. Search for **OpenWakeWord** and install it.
4. Start the **OpenWakeWord** service and enable **Start on Boot**.
5. Open **OpenWakeWord Configuration** and add the path to the custom wake word:

```yaml
wake_word_model: "/config/wakeword/ammu.tflite"
sensitivity: 0.5
```

### 4️⃣ **Restart Home Assistant**
After completing the above steps, restart **Home Assistant** to apply the changes.

### 5️⃣ **Select Wake Word in Home Assistant Voice Settings**
1. Go to **Settings** > **Voice Assistants**.
2. Under **Wake Word Detection**, choose **Custom Wake Word**.
3. Set the path to `/config/wakeword/ammu.tflite`.
4. Save and restart the voice assistant.

## 🔹 Testing the Wake Word
Once everything is set up, test the wake word:
1. Say **"Ammu"** near your microphone.
2. The **voice assistant LED should light up** (if configured).
3. Ammu AI should respond to the wake word.

🔹 **Troubleshooting**:
- If Ammu is not responding, **increase sensitivity** in the OpenWakeWord configuration.
- Check if the wake word file is correctly placed at `/config/wakeword/ammu.tflite`.
- Restart **Home Assistant** and try again.

## 🔹 Updating the Wake Word Model
You can replace `ammu.tflite` with an improved version anytime by following the same steps.

🔹 **For better accuracy, future versions will include**:
- Noise-resistant models trained with diverse environments.
- Support for additional trigger phrases.
- Improved TensorFlow Lite optimizations.
