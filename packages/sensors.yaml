    name: "Living Room Temperature"
    unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
    # Add any other sensor-specific configuration options here.
    # Example for a DHT sensor:
    # pin: GPIO23

    # Example binary sensor
  - platform: example_binary_sensor

    name: "Voice Command Active"
    # This is a placeholder.  You'd likely use a template binary sensor
